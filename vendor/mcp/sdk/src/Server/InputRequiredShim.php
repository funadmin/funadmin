/**
 * Serves a modern-era handler on a handshake-era connection.
 *
 * Revision 2026-07-28 removed server-initiated requests: a handler that needs
 * something from the user returns an {@see InputRequiredResult} naming it, and
 * the client retries the whole call with the answers. The handshake era has no
 * such retry — it has a channel back to the client instead.
 *
 * This closes that gap from the server side. When a handler returns an
 * input-required result on a handshake-era connection, each embedded request
 * goes out as the real server-to-client request it describes
 * (`elicitation/create`, `sampling/createMessage`, `roots/list`), and the
 * handler is re-entered with the answers under the keys it asked for. A handler
 * written once for the modern era therefore serves both, and cannot tell which
 * fulfilled it.
 *
 * The cost is that re-entry is re-execution: the handler runs again from the
 * top each round, so it must re-derive its position from what came back rather
 * than from anything it kept. That is already true of the modern era — the
 * client retries the whole call there — so a portable handler is written that
 * way regardless; it is only new for handlers that until now could rely on
 * {@see ClientGateway::elicit()} suspending mid-body and keeping their locals.
 * Those keep working untouched: nothing here runs unless a handler *returns* an
 * ask.
 *
 * Runs inside the handler's own fiber, so the wait for each answer is the same
 * suspension {@see ClientGateway} already uses, driven by the same transport
 * loop.
