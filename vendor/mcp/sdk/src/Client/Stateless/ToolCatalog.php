/**
 * What the client remembers from `tools/list` in order to send correct headers.
 *
 * Mirroring an argument into `Mcp-Param-*` needs the tool's `x-mcp-header`
 * annotations, which only the listing carries — by the time `tools/call` is
 * built the schema is gone unless something kept it.
 *
 * Keeping it here is also where SEP-2243's client-side obligation lands: a tool
 * whose annotations are malformed is dropped rather than called, because the
 * client cannot produce the headers such a tool demands. One bad definition
 * removes that tool and nothing else — a server with ten good tools and one
 * broken one stays usable.
