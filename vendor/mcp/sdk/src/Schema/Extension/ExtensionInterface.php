/**
 * An MCP protocol extension advertised during capability negotiation.
 *
 * Implementations are typically zero-config — they expose a stable identifier and the
 * capability payload announced under `capabilities.extensions[<id>]`. The same
 * extension object can be enabled on a server (initialize response) and on a client
 * (initialize request); the side that enables it decides which.
 *
 * An extension that only announces a capability, without adding RPC methods of its
 * own, can extend {@see AbstractExtension} and skip {@see self::getMessages()} and
 * {@see self::getRequestHandlers()} entirely.
