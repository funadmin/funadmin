/**
 * The server's preferences for model selection, requested of the client during sampling.
 *
 * Because LLMs can vary along multiple dimensions, choosing the "best" model is
 * rarely straightforward.  Different models excel in different areas—some are
 * faster but less capable, others are more capable but more expensive, and so
 * on. This interface allows servers to express their priorities across multiple
 * dimensions to help clients make an appropriate selection for their use case.
 *
 * These preferences are always advisory. The client MAY ignore them. It is also
 * up to the client to decide how to interpret these preferences and how to
 * balance them against other considerations.
